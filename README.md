# Predicting-Extended-Length-of-Stay-in-ICUs-Using ML_Models
This GitHub repository aims to develop predictive models for identifying patients with extended stays in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) using the MIMIC-IV dataset. The project focuses on enhancing resource allocation efficiency, early identification of patient risks, and supporting informed decision-making in healthcare.
The dataset, sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, includes records of patients with seven or more days in the ICU without disease-specific filters. The analysis covers diverse data elements, and preprocessing steps involve ICD-9 to ICD-10 code conversion, handling missing values and outliers, and processing time series data. The final model, trained on an 80-20 split of training and test data, incorporates patient diagnoses, chart events, and medication records, considering 2-hour intervals within 24-hour windows for improved predictive accuracy. Oversampling is applied to address class imbalance in the datase.
